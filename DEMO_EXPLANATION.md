    {
      "id": 7,
      "citizen_id": "CIT000007",
      "name": "Mam's Name",          ← Mam's name here!

cd backend
node -e "const db = require('sqlite3').verbose(); const dbFile = new db.Database('./database/enagarika.db'); dbFile.all('SELECT * FROM applications ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1', [], (err, rows) => { console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2)); dbFile.close(); });"
```
